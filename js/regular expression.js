Edmund Spenser (1552â€”1599) was born in London. He received a good education first at Merchant Taylors' School and then at Pembroke College, Cambridge. He left Cambridge in 1576 and went to the north of England, where he fell in love and recorded his laments over the loss of Rosalind in The Shepheardes Calender. Later he met Sir Philip Sidney and started a friendship with him, which sprang from a common enthusiasm for literature. In 1580, through Leicester's influence, Spenser was made secretary to Lord Grey of Wilton, the queen's deputy in Ireland. In 1586 he was given an immense estate with the castle of Kilcolm, surrounded by great natural beauty. In 1594 he married Elizabeth, and wrote his Epithalamion, one of the most beautiful wedding hymns for their marriage. In 1598 a fierce Irish rebellion forced Spenser to abandon Kilcolman Castle. Spenser never recovered from the shock of this frightful experience. He returned to England heartbroken, and in the following year he died in an inn at Westminster. According to Ben Jonson he died "for want of bread." He was buried beside his master Chaucer in Westminster Abbey.
